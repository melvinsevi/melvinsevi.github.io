# Enhancing Image Generation from Textual Prompts

![Figure 3: Comparison of Generated Images](assets/img/IP.png)


## Introduction
Our project focuses on advancing the capabilities of the IP-Adapter model for generating images from textual prompts. We propose a novel modification to the existing methodology to address the tradeoff between consistency with the reference image and introducing variation in the generated images.

## Proposed Modification
We introduce a cross-attention mechanism between the image embeddings and textual representations prior to the decoupled cross-attention mechanism used in the IP-Adapter model. This modification aims to mitigate the independent impact of the reference image on the generated image, leading to more nuanced and contextually rich outputs.

## Training Setup
We trained the modified IP-Adapter model on a dataset consisting of Rick and Morty cartoon character drawings. The training involved fine-tuning the model on a T4 GPU with a batch size of 4 for 6 epochs. We utilized fine-grained features exclusively and employed Hugging Face's Accelerate library for efficient training.

## Results
Our experimental results demonstrated a slight improvement in consistency and variation compared to the original IP-Adapter model. Quantitative comparisons using CLIP-Score showed promising performance, with our modified model achieving a mean CLIP-T score of 0.32.

## Further Research
Future research directions include exploring more sophisticated methodologies, incorporating token-based representations, leveraging masked datasets for improved training, and aligning with principles from the Vision Transformer (ViT) paper to enhance model capabilities.

## Conclusion
Our project lays the groundwork for advancing image generation models by proposing a strategic modification to the IP-Adapter architecture. While further validation on larger datasets is necessary, our results showcase the potential of our approach to improve the consistency and expressiveness of generated images.
