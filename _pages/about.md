<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">I am Melvin Sevi, a final-year Master of Research student at the prestigious [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) program (Mathematics, Vision, Apprentissage) at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://www.ens-paris-saclay.fr/) (École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay). This renowned program is distinguished for its emphasis on rigorous research, particularly in the field of machine learning. My academic journey includes a solid foundation in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), which has fueled my deep passion for pushing the boundaries of machine learning, with particular emphasis on Computer Vision and Multimodal Learning.

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">My research interests are diverse, encompassing, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models, as well as 3D computer vision.  I am driven by a desire to contribute to cutting-edge research in these areas. At present, I am actively seeking PhD positions focusing on Computer Vision.
