<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">I am Sevi Melvin, a final-year Master of Research student at the prestigious MVA program (Mathematics, Vision, Apprentissage) at ENS Paris-Saclay (École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay). As a top institution in France, it is known for its exceptional contributions to machine learning research. My academic journey includes a solid foundation in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Sorbonne University, which has fueled my deep passion for pushing the boundaries of machine learning, with particular emphasis on Computer Vision and multimodal learning.

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">My research interests are diverse, encompassing Generative AI, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models, as well as 3D computer vision.  I am driven by a desire to contribute to cutting-edge research in these areas. At present, I am actively seeking PhD positions focusing on Computer Vision where I can apply my skills and enthusiasm towards contributing to groundbreaking research.
