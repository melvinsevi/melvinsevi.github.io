<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">I am Melvin Sevi, I just graduated from the Master of Research [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)  (Mathematics, Vision, Apprentissage) at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://www.ens-paris-saclay.fr/) (École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay). This renowned program is distinguished in Europe for its emphasis on rigorous research, particularly in the field of machine learning. My academic journey also includes a solid foundation in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), which has fueled my motivation for pushing the boundaries of machine learning.

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">My research interests span diverse areas, including Diffusion Models, Language Models, and Multimodal Learning. I am deeply motivated to contribute to innovative developments in these fields. Recently, I completed an internship with the Computer Vision & Learning Group at LMU Munich, under the supervision of Prof. Björn Ommer. I am currently seeking PhD opportunities focusing on NLP and Multimodal Learning.
